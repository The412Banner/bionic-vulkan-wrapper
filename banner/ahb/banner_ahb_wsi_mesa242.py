"""Bannerlator zero-copy window layers: gralloc-backed Wayland swapchain images.

Mesa 24.2 port (leegao bionic-vulkan-wrapper tree) of Banners-Turnip patches/wayland/banner_ahb_wsi.py.
The helpers are unchanged; only the anchors differ: no color-management / loader_wayland_wrap_buffer
in this Mesa, and its surface-format loops use an unbraced `continue`.

When the compositor advertises the private global banner_ahb_v1 and wants gralloc buffers right
now, the Wayland WSI allocates
every swapchain image as an Android AHardwareBuffer (gralloc; UBWC where gralloc and the compositor
can take it, see "UBWC" below), imports the buffer's
dma-buf fd into the driver with an explicit DRM format modifier + row pitch (the same path Turnip
takes for any gralloc buffer, minus vk_android.c, which a platforms=wayland build does not have),
still shares it through zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1 (the compositor's blit path keeps working as the
fallback) and hands the AHardwareBuffer itself to the compositor once per image over a socketpair
(AHardwareBuffer_sendHandleToUnixSocket) with banner_ahb_v1.attach. The compositor then puts the
game's own buffer on a SurfaceControl layer: no copy anywhere between the game and the display.

Synchronisation stays Mesa's implicit-sync scheme (DMA_BUF_IOCTL_IMPORT/EXPORT_SYNC_FILE): the
render fence is already in the dma-buf before wl_surface.commit, the compositor exports it as the
layer's acquire fence, and imports the display's release fence back before wl_buffer.release, so
the WSI's existing acquire path (wsi_create_sync_for_dma_buf_wait) waits on it.

The wrapper, though, never waited for it: its physical device has no vk_sync types
(supported_sync_types == NULL), so wsi_signal_semaphore_for_image / wsi_signal_fence_for_image
imported fd -1 ("already signalled") into the program's semaphore / fence, and the game could render
into a buffer the display was still scanning out. The acquire semaphore and fence handles here are
the real driver's, so on a Wayland dma-buf chain (implicit sync) those two now export the dma-buf's
fences (DMA_BUF_IOCTL_EXPORT_SYNC_FILE, RW = every fence) and import that sync_file instead, through
the same driver vkImportSemaphoreFdKHR / vkImportFenceFdKHR (SYNC_FD, temporary). The flag that turns
this on (wsi_swapchain.banner_wait_dma_buf) is only ever set by the Wayland WSI below, so X11
swapchains (AHardwareBuffer presentation) behave exactly as before. BANNER_WSI_NO_DMABUF_WAIT=1 turns
it off. A kernel without the ioctl, or a driver refusing the import, falls back to fd -1 (logged once).

Acquire order (Banners-Turnip's zero-copy fps-ceiling fix, same code). Once the acquire waits for the
display's release fence, handing out the lowest-numbered free image -- Mesa's order -- takes a buffer
just back from the layer while others sit idle, and the GPU queue stalls on the display once per
refresh. For a gralloc chain the acquire polls each free image's dma-buf (poll timeout 0: POLLOUT =
every fence signalled, POLLIN = the writers, i.e. our own render, are done; POLLIN without POLLOUT =
waiting only on the display's read fence) and takes an idle image, then one waiting only on our own
rendering, then a display-held one. Every fence is still waited for.

Image count. The layer can hold three buffers at once (on screen, queued, released with a pending
fence), so a MAILBOX / IMMEDIATE swapchain created while the compositor wants gralloc images gets
BANNER_AHB_EXTRA_IMAGES (2) more images; BANNER_WSI_AHB_EXTRA_IMAGES=0..4 overrides that. FIFO is
left alone.

Who decides, and when:

  * banner_ahb_v1 version 2 (the compositor sends `mode`, which it does right after bind and again
    every time the user flips "Zero-copy presentation" in the in-game drawer): the compositor's
    mode decides, per swapchain, when the swapchain is created. BANNER_WSI_AHB=0 still forces the
    whole feature off. BANNER_WSI_AHB=1 does NOT force it on here: the app exports that variable on
    every zero-copy launch, so honouring it would freeze the live switch for exactly the sessions
    that start with zero-copy on.
  * banner_ahb_v1 version 1, or a version 2 compositor that has not sent `mode` yet: exactly the
    original contract -- gralloc images iff BANNER_WSI_AHB=1, decided per swapchain at creation,
    and no swapchain is ever retired for a mode change. A driver built from this patch therefore
    drops straight into an older Bannerlator whose compositor only advertises version 1.

A live mode change retires the swapchains that were built for the other mode: the next
vkAcquireNextImageKHR / vkQueuePresentKHR returns VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_DATE_KHR, which DXVK, vkd3d-proton
and Zink all answer by rebuilding the swapchain -- on gralloc buffers or on standard ones, whichever
the mode now is. The old chain's buffers keep working until the program lets go of it.

Without the global nothing here runs: the WSI behaves exactly as before.

UBWC. QTI gralloc compresses a buffer only when asked to: the vendor usage bit
AHARDWAREBUFFER_USAGE_VENDOR_0 (bit 28, gralloc's GRALLOC_USAGE_PRIVATE_ALLOC_UBWC) together with a GPU
usage and no CPU bit (IsUBwcEnabled in QTI's gr_utils.cpp). Qualcomm's own driver hands the Android
loader that bit for its swapchains; Mesa never sets it, so without it every gralloc swapchain here was
linear. A chain now asks gralloc, in this order:
  1. UBWC: GPU usage + COMPOSER_OVERLAY + VENDOR_0. Only when the chain's modifier list holds
     QCOM_COMPRESSED -- that list is the compositor's modifiers for the format, filtered by what the
     driver can create with this swapchain's usage, flags, format list and compression control, so it
     means both "the compositor imports UBWC here" (the app's BANNER_WAYLAND_UBWC=0 takes it away) and
     "this image may be UBWC" -- and not for storage swapchains or with BANNER_WSI_AHB_LINEAR=1.
  2. plain: GPU usage + COMPOSER_OVERLAY, gralloc's own choice (the only request before; linear on QTI).
  3. CPU-linear: plain + CPU_READ_RARELY, which gralloc can never compress.
A buffer is used only when its native handle is a QTI private handle ('gmsm') whose flags say what it
is (PRIV_FLAGS_UBWC_ALIGNED = UBWC, neither UBWC flag = linear; the UBWC_PI variant counts as
unreadable), vkCreateImage takes gralloc's pitch with that modifier, and -- for UBWC -- gralloc's
buffer holds all of the driver's UBWC image (its layout is the driver's own, from modifier + pitch).
An unreadable handle (the newer grallocs: no 'gmsm') skips request 2 and ends on 3, linear, as
before, and its ints are printed once so a reader for it can be written. So a wrong guess can only
ever cost UBWC, never produce a buffer the driver reads with the wrong layout. Each swapchain gets one
line: "on gralloc buffers: UBWC (QCOM_COMPRESSED), stride N px", or "linear, stride N px (no UBWC:
<why>)".

Written against exact source text rather than diff context so it survives Mesa line drift; every
anchor is asserted, so a Mesa where the WSI changed shape fails the build instead of shipping a
driver without the feature.
